                          <p> Hi readers, today we'll be sampling the poem 'Jack n Jill', a poem about a boy and a girl that went up to the hills to get some water and had a little disaster right after. 
                           At the end of the day, they both rose up above their little diaster. And the poem goes thus; </p>

                          <h2> Conclusion </h2>
                          <p> We can all see from the poem that Jack didn't let his fall take the best of his crown, he got up and instead of going home to whine about it,
                          he mended his crown. No matter what problems you face, you can make the best of it and turn it into a positive for yourself and no matter how 
                          many times you fall, get back up even stronger!! Thank you for reading, I really hope you enjoyed it. See ya soon. </p>
